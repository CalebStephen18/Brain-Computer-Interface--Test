# Ensemble Learning Classifier for Brain Computer Interface Applications

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of ensemble learning techniques for predictive modeling on a dataset stored in Google Drive.

### Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed by handling missing values and converting features to the appropriate data types.
2. **Model Training**: Classification models including Gradient Boosting, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and K-Nearest Neighbors are trained using the preprocessed data.
3. **Model Evaluation**: The trained models are evaluated using accuracy scores and classification reports to assess their performance.
4. **Ensemble Learning**: A voting classifier is implemented to combine predictions from multiple base models, further enhancing predictive accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python libraries: NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

## Usage

1. **Dataset location**: Ensure that the dataset (`final.csv`) is stored in the appropriate location.
2. **Running the Notebook**: Execute the notebook cells sequentially to load the data, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate their performance.
3. **Model Selection**: Compare the performance of different models and choose the most suitable one based on accuracy and classification metrics.
4. **Ensemble Model**: Experiment with the voting classifier to combine predictions from various base models and observe improvements in predictive accuracy.
